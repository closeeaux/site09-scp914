# SCP-914 Script for SCP Site 09

This script is designed for the GMod map "SCP Site 09" created by Kiwonta.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why aren't spawned weapons working?

Currently, only entities are supported. This means that only weapons dropped via the "/drop" command from DarkRP will work.

### Why isn't anything happening?

The script is currently configured to work only with Guth SCP keycards. If you want to add more weapons, you'll need to download the addon from my GitHub and edit the config.

### How does the config work?

The configuration is straightforward. If you need help, feel free to ask in the comments or send a friend request.

### Do I need to restart the server after changing something?

After editing the config, everything should work fine. If not, restart the server. If problems persist and you're not a developer, please leave a comment with the error, and I'll try to fix it.
